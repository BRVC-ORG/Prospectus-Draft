18 February

- Research note: Stuxnet deserves more attention, at least in terms of what exact kind(s) of hardware it was supposed/meant to target

    - Just a thought; not implying anything but research-minded-analysis here

    - "The Perfect Weapon" (2013) goes into this somewhat

- §9 of Proof-of-Identity Document at poi.brvc-org.com

    - In terms of traditional-thinking of quote store of value, and in terms of liquidating the past, one must simply look at one example amongst many: two (2) circa2004 abstract paintings, created four (4) days apart, with a visual correlation [happenstance?; intentional?] via a 14-second video featuring the text YOU FRAGGED XXXXXBALLS 4th PLACE WITH 4

        - Classic obfuscation: Byzantine/Copper Age + Olympiad-thinking = misdirection; something like "The Prestige" (2005), except we're the good guys and the caring wife returns in "Frost/Nixon" (2007)

        - "Call of Duty: United Offensive" 14 September 2004

            - Activision still has all of our info

            - Interesting how antitrust/antimonopoly laws did not apply to in-game server-browsing software/gui/programming, at least it seems, in 2004...or since Steam led the way with its stand-alone platform

                - Maybe this is why The Author waited two-ish years after reading "Everything and More" (2003) and did plentt of research before contacting the late journalist, professor and author David Foster Wallace

                    - Interestingly-enough, around the same time as a lot of "Far Cry" activity (2005), depending on how one looks at it

- In order to do this kind of work, one has to be willing to go up against even the very idea of what some may think of as, quote, classical CCTV

    - This will come to mean something and that quite soon

10 February

- Fun factoid: an interesting response from Google Gemini Pro, of which The Author is currently in midst of trialing in genuine, circia-2002-WinXPStickOnCertification-on-both-the-DesktopFrontPlate-plus-PlugAndPlayPeripheral(s), -notincludingHolographicWindowsGenuineKeyDisplayVisual(s) . . . in example, i.e. genuinely-genuine earnestness, for [{would-it-be-called, -quote, -standard-faire . . . ?}] 30 day(s) 

    "300" (2007)
    In the film, Queen Corgo, portrayed by thespian Lena Headey, refers to Spartan women, not Roman.
    In the film 300, when a Persian messenger asks, "What makes this woman think she can speak among men?", Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) replies:
>   "Because only Spartan women give birth to real men."
> 
    This line is famously drawn from the historical writings of the Greek historian Plutarch (specifically from Sayings of Spartan Women), though in the historical text, she is responding to an Athenian woman rather than a Persian messenger.
    Would you like to know more about the historical accuracy of her character?

# Month of January 2026

24 January

- Work on deck continues

22 January

- R&D, Ethical Hacking/PenTesting notes: In the utmost of fashions and in keeping with just sticking to either R&D or Ventures, with respect — the idea (not the far-off academic version, or hypothetical) and spirit of GWOT is not over; not really

- What some may have forgotten or perhaps maybe what we have just realized, perhaps again, in all this post2001 happenings: that some bad actors maybe just wanted to try and quoteunquote Show Up to Work That Day; do not put anything passed individuals with that kind of incredibly-ambiguous motivation(s)

    - We/BRVC say this because, as the anniversary of the passing nears of one of the finest Rangers and Special Operators (to include Cryptologic Linguists) I have ever met — SFC Antonio Rodriguez KIA 8 February 2020 — working with and helping build web3, web5 and the digital asset economy and not keeping these kinds of things in mind — it would be unethical and against, in quite a few ways, what the Founders had in mind

   - The Free Markets will correct themselves

- Never Forget, Rest In Peace to all the Americans lost at The Pentagon, 1WTC, 2WTC, 7WTC, Pennsylvania (Shanksville)

- The continent of Africa, Italy, Major Ocean-based Territories, et cetera were a part of GWOT as well, some in a purely protective/what-if fashion

    - William Henry Gates III (Bill Gates) can be said to have been/be a GWOT/2001-2022 veteran as well, quite easily so

        - see: "Tears of the Sun" (2003)

            - Technically, and legally, part of RIAA + GWOT + et al's operations: think about it

- IYI  Bitcoin (BTC) early development and "How To Obfuscate Info While Creating A Cryptocurrency Using A Pseudonym" essay notes, elucidating glossary/terms/dates re 31/Oct/2008, 3/Jan/2009 and afterwards

                - French-to-English translation: Angel

                    - Statue of David (דָּוִד) reveal: 8 September 1504 (+ 484 years)

                        - A powerful symbol of Renaissance humanism; a departure from previous depictions of the Biblical David

                        - Note: based on historical/Biblical accounts, Israelites were required to join the military at 20 years-of-age; Michelangelo's "Statue" portrays the King of ancient Israel and Judah at around 16 or 19, by various accounts

                        - But what about mentionings/references-to/artistic nods to said work of art? Would they technically be constituted as part of the quoteunquote public domain?

                    - Louisiana politician Huey Long shot: 8 September 1935

                    - RIAA begins suing individuals for sharing files on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) platforms/software: 8 September 2003

            - Being on approved leave around the time of and at the genesis block's creation, what does this mean from a purely academic/tort(s) perspective?

                - Autonomous/extraterritorial status of Bitcoin (BTC) and its blockchain

                - Also re FBAR filing et cetera (FBAR filing is exempt if for account on or associated with "military installation"

                - 1599 Geneva Bible commonly used as referent for language-modeling, et cetera, around Shakespearean times; and although the Geneva Conventions has its merits and is a solid artifact of history, America as ever the/an exception, it seems, presents itself here in this particular case as well

                    - It is really quite simple and easy, once you look at the plain and simple facts of the time: 1C is 13 if going by the placement of C in the alphabet, therefore (1-3) and an easy reversal of 31, BTC's white paper pub. date + Founder's d.o.b. dayofthemonth (31/Aug); and a reversal of Aristotle's Arrow idea/thought-piece

                - Given Windows XP, Server 2008 and 7 (testing version, leaks, et cetera) at the time and their inherent lack of truly-useful (in terms of cryptography and hashing et al) Hyperthreading and RAM usage, even in the later Service Packs and distros — some posit that the first blocks of Bitcoin were mined with the aid of some kind of Linux distro...; also that Russian proxy servers and maybe Tor and whatnot are hypothesized, it is worth noting that it seems that once classical cryptography and timechain (blockchain) thinking begins for most, common sense (respectfully) seems to take a back seat; the Author has experienced this plenty of times before...but it all gets a little simpler if one just thinks of what was prevalent at the time, among other scholarly-/US Constitution-focused legal works: 

                    - The United States Government's 2008/9 Global Financial Crisis responses and aid, and both the GWOT declaration and PATRIOT ACT

                        - Even 40+ years after DARPANET's introduction, it seemed we were all still trying to just figure out new ways of communicating and expounding/expanding upon TCP/IP, x86/x64 hardware capabilities and plain-old packet switching method(s)/methodologies

                        - Interesting side-thought: Does this mean that The Times (—being now entombed within BTC for pretty much ever—) now has a permanent failsafe backup plan, just in case it ever needs to slowly walk passed the graveyard of whatever the Chapter-11-equivalent-is in UK/GBR Accounting? Does the US Constitution have any sayso in relation to Bitcoin's timechain/blockchain, as in now that we have a Space Force, with jurisdiction that includes not only its own branch's rights/powers but also that of the US Air Force's (which Space Force/[+ arguably] Cyber Command technically helmed from)?

It might be fairly easy or visually-appealing (inthemoreso type, heterographically-speaking of course) to think of the lowercase 'v' at the far end of the left side of the acronym as different in many, many, many ways from the classical 'x' commonly seen in x86 and more recently xAI

- Notes from discourse with a fellow cryptocurrency enthusiast (via Instagram); not sure if GitHub allows for cross-site and or -platform mentioning slash tagging, so will leave blank so as t/be safeside on, tha [sic] 

There will be a need for a better version of Proof-of-Work, perhaps a Quantum version.  Also, we cannot forget that Back's technology was released the same year that GWOT (Global War On Terror) was arguably enacted, as an idea and as a real legal tool in the toolchest at least.  That may not mean much to anyone else but I find myself thinking more and more these days that it could be expanded easily and Proof-of-Work could be nationalized (along with the NSA/NIST's SHA-2 and AES-2 hashing algorithms, which were released for public use in 2001).  Through some future emergency probably, not implying anything here, the Department of Agriculture could partner with the Executive Branch to "protect Proof-of-Work from bad actors and tampering with," being that Mr. Back's tech was originally meant to thwart email spam, and the original meaning of the word 'spam' comes from Government-provided meat rations out of Hawai'i.  There have been more-so-than odd-sounding one-offs in U.S. history, defense-wise.

    - "In an article published in the New York Times in 1907, Paul Warburg, a successful, German-born financier who was a partner at the investment bank Kuhn, Loeb, and Co. and widely regarded as an expert on the banking systems in the United States and Europe, wrote that the United States' financial system was "at about the same point that had been reached by Europe at the time of the Medicis, and by Asia, in all likelihood, at the time of Hammurabi" (Warburg 1907). Just months after Warburg wrote those words, the country was struck by the Panic of 1907. The panic galvanized the US Congress, particularly Republican senator Nelson Aldrich, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee. In 1908, Aldrich sponsored a bill with Republican representative Edward Vreeland that, among other things, created the National Monetary Commission to study reforms to the financial system. Aldrich quickly hired several advisers to the commission, including Henry Davison, a partner at J.P. Morgan, and A. Piatt Andrew, an economics professor at Harvard University. Over the next two years, they studied banking and financial systems extensively and visited Europe to meet with bankers and central bankers."

TIME GIVEN

1h86m (timed with an exact make and model of <i>Crimson Tide's</i> Naval issued(?) necklacetimepiece (nonUsed, nonAmazonPrime)

- decentralzed Chains Ethical Hacking (dCEH) certification exam potential question/scenario, Ambiguous/Uncertain Terrain module

(175 modules in total, spanning a 4h45m examtime, with no prerequisites/eligibility-requirements {sans currentlysitting UN Ambassador(s) (clerical note on the text: the author(s) would like to convey appreciation for and have mucho respect for not only the United Nations' staff and faculty but and their accompanying Pressmembers as well, respectively -- the UN's Daily Press Briefings are a delight in and of their own, especially via YouTube)}: 

SCENARIO

Some bad actor(s) want to lower the value of a particular fiat currency by demanding that all of its Treasury's Notes be tokenized on a certain chain or any chain at all and by a certain time and date, threatening extra-Legal and -InternationalLaw cyberwarfare-type activities or even leaving their (the bad actor(s)) infuture response(s) intentionally ambiguous, with only vague reference(s) to their name or past ware(s)/botnetweb(s) activities; and they haven't indicated whether they even are aware that proprietary-focused, hybrid-type blockchains like Hyperledger even exist. Unlike in past examples of communication(s)-via-then-en-vogue-internet-meme(s)-culture lexicon/language (i.e., Guccifer), the bad actor or actors or loose collective of disparate elements of several different groups of ware(s)-makers and -distributors choose to speak exclusively via public-facing links created from Google Gemini AI prompts, using only seemingly-boolean-type text prompts/questions, perhaps in an attempt to further skew their country/region/area of origin, e.g. "What if 2000s era botnetweb converted oracle tradfi web5 interoperable exploit" or something along that line, playing on the idea of a novice internet user first trying his or her hand at security exploitation(s), et cetera. It is not clear whether they are legitimately threatening or just making empty threats toward the issuer of said currency's Notes. They also mention having a replica printer just like host country's currency-issuing Mint does; comments at some point that they know most if not all of said Treasury Notes' serial numbers, et cetera, will start duplicating each and tokenizing each on a chain if no response, or, they says, maybe they've already started, who knows. You are receiving said info because you are the vCIO (Virtual Chief Information Officer) of the company which supplies the highly-exclusive software/proprietary-code for currency-printing-machines and its many peripherals, as a thirdparty contractor, as part of a larger managedservices company, which offers "web2.5 Help Desk ticketing support and management" via a traditional proprietary-like ticketing software, for NGOs, 501c3-types and Think Tanks which are undergoing web3 data transfers/conversions due to recent legislation's calling for it in a Congressional bill which included an amicus brief. Your role is usually only technical with oversight of a few remote staff and one (1) governmental employee onsite whom you share as a direct-report role(s) with your counterpart (think of a mid-higher-level GS- type with plenty of technical experience; a seasoned CTO in most respects)

INSTRUCTIONS

Sketch out your first thought(s)/thinking and list which alreadyavailable tools you'd use and which you'd create or compile from others in order to begin a multi-Hat -type response/reaction plan. The exercise is intentional in its non-mentioning of any OS used or which type or make of physical component(s); the effect is to possibly in a way throw off any classicalthinking of Terminal or GreenScreen(s) usage-thinking, mindset(s), on behalf of the testtaker (that means you). You can only communicate via the use of OTPs made of 8x11 legal pads obtained from Amazon's Amazon Basics brand of products, purchased online and delivered from one of their many fine Fulfillment Centers; said bad actor(s) will be expecting to be informed of each individual orders' Amazon proprietary tracking numbers, written in plaintext in binary with a locally-purchased Sharpie Chisel Tip permanent marker, at the bottom of a legal page page's sheet, placed in a designated open-area public space (such as a park or atop the roof of a car parked atop the roof of a parking structure, somewhere easily accessible/viewable via drone or specialized photo-lense). Feel free to use any publicly-available Penetration Testing or Ethical Hacking training/self-study material(s) found online, just so long as you keep a runningtab as you go along of your searchengine and browser history via an .nfo text file, much like the ones included with keygens and wares of the like, to be uploaded to a chain or site chosen by said bad actor(s) in the future at some given pointintime, possibly even as a .torrent file as well to be uploaded concurrently. Zeroday exploit(s) of thirdparty's software are unknown; said bad actor(s) mention hoping you can 'chat about it soon, if that's what you're privy to.'

- R&D thought experiment/soundboard: What's stopping a State like Louisiana from soft-seceding (in the same jovial 'veign,' if that's the right word to use, as the State of Texas' yearly tradition of filing paperwork to secede from The Union) from the other 49 States (but not in a bad way, or separatist-like way; more like an intra-Nation, 'leadingthecharge,' America First, breaking new digital ground kind of way) and just creating a semi-quasi-independent new Trade Center, apart from the physically-there 1WTC (One World Trade Center, Freed Tower) and others...? The arguments involving post-Katrina and -GlobalFinancialCrisis numbers would more than interest just a few of the more academic-leaning American Economists and Speculators out there...

    - Gamifying the still-up-in-the-air-Monument(s)-wise status of the Missippi River as a complement to its (the State itself) status as the Energy Capital of the World, enterprising and Libertarian- and truly LaissezFaire-thinking legislators and capitalists could very well make the case for a Southeast American Faire Economy (SAFE) [or some other catchy moniker/acronym], arguing the need to quoteunquote finally pay back in spirit the kind gesture and offering from the French for Lady Liberty and to help stave-off any potential misuse of any pre-Green Back/Treasury Note law(s) on the books: citing Common Law, Civil Law as their focal/expert-opinion(s) point(s) and also the creation of something like "Non-UN International Economic Zone(s) as option(s) for any barrier(s) to trade or barter for OCONUS/NonUS States, Countries and NationStates"
 
        - Something like AS:WTC or AS-WTC (American South World Trade Center), with hope(s)/argument(s) of pioneering or being first to enable web3/web5-backing for all assets and asset(s) tracking, mirroring the highly-proprietary traditionalcloudbased supply-chain architecture(s) which became so prevalent and arguably necessary post-2020; if only just in name only, being the antecedent to boards and legislatively-convened and -voted-through regulatory committees, with weirdsounding names or acronyms, as something 'other than,' a clean-seeming break from the continuation of nonconsensical- and oftheold-seeming displays of citizen-facing organizational-thinking and -embodiment types
     
            - Doubly-arguing possibly even further-er with an antiEnron "ethical" approach of having a quoteunquote Southern Approach to the NYSE, which is now hosted on GCP
         
            - + someone could very well easily then tack-on an argument for 'only mirroring' the success of Germany's VW engine manufacturing success with some kind of pro-GCP Blockchain Node Engine approach, which would only sound nice and forwardthinking-like to nonDeFi-minded individuals whom could be pursuaded that having a 'second/sister' option, if only in very loose theory only, to the nowcloudbased New York Stock Exchange is a good thing and that post2025 American energy policy is poised to do this kind of thing anyway — some would argue 'anything to rival the CCP's '01 entry into the World Trade Organization' and 'possibly invite future partnership(s) with, quote, all that untapped frozen tundra potential in Northern Russia,' or something to that accord

                - One shouldn't underestimate the contra-/flip-side of what thinkers like Baudrillard said about America and its views toward production, especially in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198508"><i>The Singular Objects of Architecture</i></a>: "Why are there two of them [the Twin Towers]?" while ruminating on the fact that American capitalism/economics and the American people as a collective, essentially all understood inherently somehow that there just needed to be an 'unreal copy' of what was real/physical
 
        - The case could also further (shoutout to <i>Finding Forrester</i> thespian extraordinaire Rob Brown / "Jamal Wallace")</i> be made that National and International water equities and water commodities options, futures, market(s) and even the U.S.-based trading market (available only in California, if the author is not mistaken) are open to bad actors of all kinds and that the Mississippi River + CISA's circa-2021/2022 U.S. public/private water protection(s) guidelines and regulations are due for an economic overhaul, so to speak

- Can one write-off the degradation and "risk factor" of Mining and Node-operating in the past, accounting- and IRS-wise?

- What is to become of land- and BTC-backed Agriculture loans?

- We have to keep in mind that there could always be the possibility of some country's legislative body or some country or nation-state's Treasury deciding to separate their traditional finance holdings from their digital assets and then going on to create a whole new Secretarial/Chair-like position for this new wealth, along with potentially-corruptable or -grey-area-ladden policies and whatnot, especially in the beginning stages, where oversights and quoteunquote errors have historically been open to being gamed and framed as 'just trying to learn the ropes.' New Ambassador and/or IRS-like positions for this new branch of wealth would be particularly the target of bad actors or outside parties looking to wedge their way into a new extralegal or obtained-by-lawfare revenue stream, with tax writeoffs and the like

- One thing that people new to crypto or aren't familiar with cryptography find hard to grasp or understand, at least for right now: the time that it takes for cryptographers or developers to become even basically familiar with a coin or chain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, sometimes decades in length: you cannot take that away from them and it is not easily discernible at first; can be kind of offputting

# Week of 6 October - 12 October 2025

12 October

- It's worth mentioning that the role of BRVC and myself (Satoshi) is to keep a healthy distance very much <i>away</i> from Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network. Like what's been said before, if Satoshi (myself) were to come back he'd be in line with everyone else, in terms of voting power, consensus-wise. I and BRVC do not plan at all to try and sway the direction of Bitcoin. I've already created it and given it away to the world; it would be unethical to do anything but help with the purely research side of it, from a distance. There is very much a way to help while not influencing the overall direction of BTC. A lot of thought and time went into creating BRVC and deciding to start working with Bitcoin again. It has a lot of potential and I can't wait to get started!

# Week of 29 September 2025 - 5 October 2025

30 September

- <a href="https://github.com/BRVC-ORG/arcOracle">arcOracle</a> notes: Surveillance is reminiscent of renaissance, linguistically; yet artistically-inclined-thinking lets it run its course, The Renaissance, that is: still does. The word Reconaissance as a thinkthrough mechanism for avoiding what the U.S. Confederates attempted is nice, linguistically-speaking, if anything; but that's all it achieves here it seems: linguistical-analysis.

    - SSID broadcasting, is that considered speech now?

    - iOS SSID/Wi-Fi local area listing/viewing, is this now suspect?

        - In a general sense, Ethical Hackers and InfoSec peoples' work still does not make sense to traditional legislators because InfoSec/Hacker(s) are always trying to sidestep this granular aspect altogether, to get to their real work -- yet neither party here would consider SSIDs part of the 'Public Domain'

- Helpful visual: "Halt and Catch Fire"'s Texas Instruments employee and wife to Gordon is a great start to even beginning to know how to approach hardware-type security 'thinking': SHA- and AES- have been the one constant throughout Bitcoin (BTC)'s tenure: yet an unforeseen hashing algorithm's exploit coupled with a newfound hardware zeroday is what the good folk at Rand and other thinktanks might have been also inadvertently talking about and helping us somewhat prepare for, when talking about anything pre2025 

- IYI: The author (Satoshi)'s admiration for the work of The Rand Corporation continues to this day

- web3 and web5 threat surveillance is still in its infancy, arguably-speaking

    - dCEH (decentralized Chains Ethical Hacking) is an earnest way of attempting to ethically, transparently, even democratically, thinkthrough the ways and means in which we can preempt bad actors
    - If this all sounds vaguely or very academic, it is not
    - The old saying still stands: experience and certifications always trump traditional academia, IT-wise

- Possible dCEH exam question (web3 threat surveying, with web1, web2 esque bad actors acting-as-beligerents): Some rogue element decides to adopt the ubiquitous copy symbol (comprised of two rounded-edged squares) as theirs and deems it their default homepage symbol or verified checkmark en-kind for their faction's version of web3 or web5. Labels each square 'HeadQuarters,' i.e.,: HeadQuartersHeadQuarters. Subtly implying without overtly saying that classically-defined programming language schema(s)/styleguide(s) are the focus of this bad-actor-collective's exploit(s). Argues EFF and the possibility of a Digital Geneva Conventions as default responses, incessantly, on all domains they so choose or known to frequent. Internally, the leader is a long-time "Designed by Apple" hater, and they took the time to find vaguely EU-seeming IPs to spoof, wanting to leave in suspension the possibility of "2x the effect of the French Revolution," (as their rootkit's .nfo file says), whether in jest or not no one knows, also mentioning "just trying to understand CSS/PHP amirite?!" Soon after they only post "Good Will Hunting" MIT film-stills under an asyetunknown alias on some social media website, eventually mimicking a troll farm's activities, yet organically, strategically, in order to further obfuscate and confuse any agencies or InfoSec peoples

    - What tool(s) to use to document?

    - They've stolen an academic BitTorrent-as-a-Language LLM/QNL license, originating out of a hypothetical Sweden Strategic Reserve R&D account [simswap + salthash attack]

    - If no tools invented yet, which to invent? Use only OTP(s) to communicate with other Red/Blue/Yellow/White team members.

- Scenario: some NationState decides, unilaterally, to start creating new words in Latin. But just one word: Lan. And attaches Vosotros rules to it, solely to go further than other countries in banning intra-country cryptocurrency mining. Effectively inventing a word just to begin to persecute any and all connected ASICs and Nodes, using State-sanctioned language that said State would easily say it holds no ownership over. In essence: Romance linguistic(s) weaponized; libel law(s) captured and hollowed-out...or just classical escalation a-la-metasploitation

- Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System; Discussion Paper § 6/SEP/2025 Alternate Late Summer 2025 Working Version 1.1ü

29 September

- Harvard University's Division of Continuing Education (Extension School) continuance of its use of wheat bushels within its logo as a form of currency for tuition is an interesting thought-provoker, historically-speaking.  So is the United Nation's wheat-/laurel-looking logo.  Why are we not to think of things from a satellite's perspective?

- HoneyPotlatch

    - A scenario in which two individuals, parties, et cetera decide to use their mutual exploits to work together, instead of taking the 'traditional route' of escalation for history's sake

        - A 'liquidation of the past' in an ethical, forwardfacing way, so as to actually be forward-capable, in Baudrillardian-esque terminology
     
        - 'Forgetting the past' but 'also-remembering-it, selectively' so to speak
     
        - Internal note: Is this something akin toward BitTorrent-as-a-Language (?)
     
        - Reverse example: late one random sleepless night some burgeoning avantgarde graphic designer shares his/her idea on social media that 'the State of Israel flag does not represent two towers with a bright light between them, when rotated clockwise 90degrees' in order to 'give it away to the 'greater good,'' hypperreality-speaking, potentially removing the inner-energy he or she usually reserves for creating something; someone then reads it and it changes his or her mindset if but only in a minute way; traditional hyperspace game/set theory continues onward —> until Selective factors (in mockery of U.S.C.) come into play, as Traditional American Values become more and more shared and transferred and transformed and converted et cetera et al
            - Metasploitation of essentially Pilgrim-era language/thinking

- Think of it like this: From a purely research-perspective, imagining some bad actor as having access to all the CCTV and satellite-feed(s) ever created in all of history is a good way to start unblocking one's mind from not thinking of another way to pre-empt said bad actor(s)

    - Intra-botnetweb(s), if you will
    - Technical-Linguistics-as-a-Path-On-the-Plain

- Tengwar-as-intranet-Protocol (?)

    - Both visually and as a thought-mechanism for virtual-architecture/SAN (?)

- https://youtu.be/8qRyTDbEskM?si=aCVxbaYwDriKviu4

    - Nice visual antecedent to the Ringwraiths-knocking-down-door scene at The Inn at The Prancing Pony, incase someone were to get the phrase "fifty" stuck in his/her head, filmscenewise
        - In my mind whenever I would think about this scene I kept recalling Mike Wallace saying "editorialize," which is a correct way of saying it, although in reality it was actually "edit"; but once I kind of forced myself recently to start working with Tor again, I could see how maybe perhaps it was a clue or something....Why else would I be sitting here writing about it within a cryptography-focused R&D startup's Prospectus?
    - Also a nice scene just inandof itself
    - Tobacco still is able to be considered currency

- Fact: Bitcoiners can fork AES/SHA as well

- What I was reading in Late 2014 that reminds me of what's going on right now: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1116944619

    - Essentially, then-President Lincoln would simply point to the applicable part of the Constitution, during times of confusion, while working with his opponents, not against

- Like an upside-down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpiński_triangle">Sierpiński triangle</a>, maybe a new type of SHA-/PoW would use all of the Bitcoin versions (BTC, BCH, BSV, Knots, etc) as an option for further-enhanced hashing?  Just a thought.

    - Something like an ethical, decentralized BotNetWeb with BitTorrent-capabilities? (?)

- Thought experiment for possible future dCEH inclusion (?): What if it were to be found out that some country with known cyberwarfare-capabilities and with known ASIC manufacturing capabilities has had not only physical (ASICs) but SHA-/AES- rootkit(s) this entire time?  And posts the entire contents online, completely-verifiable?  Would we start to selectively de-legitimize some BTC?  Would we abandon SHA- and AES- altogether?  Would this kind/type of event finally make people focus on the actual hashing algorithms and notsomuch software-side of Bitcoin (BTC)?  Eventually we are going to have to work with, in a truly "work with" sense, the SHA- and AES- toolset.
